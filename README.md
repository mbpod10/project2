### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP. Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

#### MVP

- Pull data using api that allows forex to render on the page
- Render data, info, on the page
- Have different links
- have a basic aesthetic design
- have a lot of white space

#### PostMVP

- allow for history of prices
- Allow people to preview their favorite forex searches
- Have people able to contact me via website
- Find data or algorithm that will allow signals in price disparities
- make the webpage more interactive or even change its layout for better optimal viewership

## Functional Components

- The absolute most functionial component had to be the API rendering from European Central Bank database of my various projects
- Also, the page has to be resonsive that depends on what type of device the user is using
- Also, it has to present a clean and representation of my skill as a Reach developer
