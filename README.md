# Project Overview

## Project Description

For this project, I plan to make a foreign exchange app. I will use React to naviaget throughout the application where I will allow the user to view different currencies and their different exhange rates.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP. Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

#### MVP

- Pull data using api that allows forex to render on the page
- Render data, info, on the page (USD as default)
- Have a nav bar on the left side of the screen
- Allow the user to click in the nav and go straight to a certain currency (except home and about)
- In the individual currency link, the user will see the currency and its exchange rates with other currencies
- have a basic aesthetic design
- make the application responsive
- HAVE NAME OF CURRENCY AND COUNTRY RENDER ON SCREEN (probable post MVP-- not in dataset)
- potentially allow the user to view historical data (probable post MVP)

#### PostMVP

- Allow people to preview their favorite forex searches
- Have people able to contact me via website
- Find data or algorithm that will allow signals in price disparities
- make the webpage more interactive or even change its layout for better optimal viewership
- find standard deviation movements in certain currencies based on historical price movements
- have the flags of countries render next to their currencies
- allow charts

## Functional Components

- The absolute most functionial component had to be the API rendering from European Central Bank database of my various projects
- Also, the page has to be resonsive that depends on what type of device the user is using
- Also, it has to present a clean and representation of my skill as a Reach developer
